# Changelog

All notable changes to Weft are documented in this file. Weft follows semantic versioning;
pre-1.0 the API may change between minor versions.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-17

Initial release: the complete engine as a Composer library (`golovanov/weft`), with a working
example site that doubles as the documentation.

### Added

- Convention routing: `pages/about.php` → `/about`, directory indexes, `[slug]` dynamic
  segments, `api/*.php` → JSON endpoints under `/api/*`; no route table.
- SEO toolkit: title templates, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter cards, hreflang and JSON-LD
  rendered from config with per-page overrides; generated `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`.
- Optional i18n (off by default): prefix-free default locale, prefixed URLs for others,
  automatic hreflang and canonical redirects, translation arrays in `lang/<locale>/`.
- Optional caching with file and Redis stores; `Cache::remember()` stays a safe no-op when
  caching is disabled.
- Request tracing: one JSONL timeline per request via golovanov/traceloom, with automatic
  redaction of sensitive keys and an `X-Trace-Id` response header.
- Form protection: rate limiting, CSRF tokens, honeypot check and optional Google
  reCAPTCHA v3 (safe pass when disabled).
- Best-effort alerting to AlertLoop that never blocks a request.
- Built-in utilities: curl-based HTTP client, thin PDO wrapper with a minimal model, JWT
  (firebase/php-jwt), security headers, string/array/JSON helpers.
- Vite integration: dev server with HMR in development, hashed production assets resolved
  from the manifest.
- Two-layer configuration: gitignored environment constants plus committed business config
  read via `config('dot.keys')`.
- `example/` — a complete working site that is also the engine's documentation
  (`example/content/en/`).
